### "Run, Hide or Fight" here's my answer

hey Luna, i'm sorry for not noticing your new playlists earlier, honestly i was too scared to even check, uhmm i've been thinking a lot this past few days, about our future, i've specifically been thinking if it's even possible for us to get there, and i've kind of accepted that you're fucked, uhmm sorry i can't think of another way to word it, it's just yeah i don't think this'll fix itself. i know you'll probably never read this, maybe i'm late, in fact i'm probably late, maybe the fear of being late was what made me be late in the first place, not that it matters anyways, but uhmm Luna.

i've reached a conclusion.

life fucking sucks and sometimes we can't do anything to fix it, i believe this is one of those occasions, but at the same time, i just can't give up yet, life fucking sucks, it's unjust, it's fierce and does not care about anyone, but dammit i just can't give up, i know that you're the one that's suffering the most because of this, not only are we separated, you're also going through a lot because of your parents, but uhmm, i guess i just had to set my fears apart, because at the end of the day, if i just, let them conquer me, if i just go back to being the person i used to be, then it'll all be for nothing, Luna, i can't give up, i know that i'm in no position to say this but, Luna. you can't give up either.

the world's unfair, it's fierce it's unjust but, at the end of the day, it is our world it's our reality and it's all we have, and if it doesn't want me to live a happy life, well it should've killed me, because i've realized that i can't give up, i just can't i literally can't, and i want to believe that deep down, you also feel that way.

Luna, i'm not going to give up so i'm going to give you my answer, i'm going to tell you what i'm going to do.

I'm going to fight, for the future that we dreamed of, I'll fight, so that one day it's not longer just a dream.

Luna, i don't know what you'll pick or what you've picked but, that's my answer, i love you Luna, i love you so much, i'm going to fight so that we can one day live happily ever after, i love you Luna, i know that you can do this.
