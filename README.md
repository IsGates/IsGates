Luna i love you and i'm so so sorry, i hope that she compromises, but, even if she doesn't i'll wait for you, Luna i love you so so so much and no matter what happens, i'll always love you, so uhmm, honestly, i don't know what i should say. it's just, yeah. Luna i know you'll probably not get to read this but still, i love you Luna, and i hope that your mother can one day realize that this is who you truly are Luna, but even if she doesn't, i'll still be there for you.

i love you Luna, i love you so so much, stay strong. i know you can do this. i'll be waiting for you
